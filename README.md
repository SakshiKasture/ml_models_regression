# Machine Learning Models: Linear and Logistic Regression from Scratch

## Project Description
This project demonstrates the implementation of Linear Regression and Logistic Regression models from scratch using Python. The results are compared with Scikit-learn's implementations for accuracy and performance.

## Features
- Linear Regression:
  - Gradient descent algorithm for parameter optimization.
  - Comparison with Scikit-learn's `LinearRegression`.
  - Visualizations of regression lines.
- Logistic Regression:
  - Gradient descent for binary classification.
  - Comparison with Scikit-learn's `LogisticRegression`.
  - Decision boundary visualizations.
- Regularization
  - Ridge
  - Lasso
  - ElasticNet


## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn
